This folder (and namespace) contains classes that function on Windows ONLY and will NEVER function on other platforms.

Efforts should ALWAYS be made to provide cross-platform functionality to a class, but for some things which simply are Windows only, for example, shortcuts, Windows 7 jump lists, MSI installers, and other things, they must be placed in this namespace.
