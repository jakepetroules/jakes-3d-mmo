This folder contains all fully cross-platform code. It mainly consists of utilities and extensions to lessen the amount of code written for simple tasks.

Folders surrounded with square brackets indicate a grouping of similar types of code, rather than a namespace folder.

Note that although Windows Forms controls will look foreign on non-Windows platforms, code that functions with them on all platforms (since Windows Forms IS implemented in Mono) will be placed in the NetUtilities core.
